1. Corrected Code

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 10;
```

2. Syntax Errors

âœ… No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- Avoid using `SELECT *` in production; explicitly specify column names for clarity and performance, e.g., `SELECT CustomerID, Name, ...`.
- Ensure consistent naming conventions (e.g., `CustomerID` vs `CustomerId`). Confirm column name case with your DBMS since some (e.g., PostgreSQL) are case-sensitive.
- Add an `ORDER BY` clause if a specific order is required (e.g., `ORDER BY CustomerID`).

4. Requirement Mismatch

**Mismatch Found:**  
The requirement is to display customer details for `CustomerId > 10`.  
**Uploaded Query:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
- The uploaded code incorrectly uses `> 30` instead of `> 10` as specified.

**Correction:**  
Change `CustomerID > 30` to `CustomerID > 10` as shown in the corrected code above.  
**Conclusion:** The uploaded query does **not** fully satisfy the requirement.
