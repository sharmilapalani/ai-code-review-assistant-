**Review of your code:**

Your SQL code is syntactically correct and will retrieve all columns (`*`) from the `Customer` table where the `CustomerID` value is greater than 30.

**However**, I have a few suggestions to make your code better according to SQL best practices:

---

### 1. Use Explicit Columns

Instead of using `SELECT *`, specify the columns needed, for performance and readability.  
For example, if you want `CustomerID`, `FirstName`, and `LastName`:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

---

### 2. Formatting and Clarity

- Put each clause on a new line for readability.
- Capitalize keywords.

---

### 3. Table/Column Names

Double-check whether your table and column names match your schema.  
If there are aliases, mention that.

---

### 4. Consistency

If using SQL code in production, it's a good practice to qualify table names with the schema, e.g. `dbo.Customer` (if you are using SQL Server).

---

## **Corrected Code (Best Practice Version)**

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

**Or, if you really want all columns:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

---

### **Summary**

- Your original code is correct.
- It's better to specify the columns you need.
- Use consistent formatting and double-check actual table/column names.

Let me know if you have a specific requirement or if this query needs to be adapted to a specific SQL dialect!
