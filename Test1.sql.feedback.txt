1. Corrected Code

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

---

2. Syntax Errors

- The `SELECT` statement is missing the column list (e.g., `*` or specific columns).
- The `FROM` keyword comes after the column list in standard SQL.
- Proper SQL statements should end with a semicolon (optional in some environments, but a good practice).

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- Specify the columns you actually need instead of using `*` (e.g., `SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customer`) for better performance and clarity.
- Consider indexing the `CustomerID` column if queries like this are frequent and the table is large.
- Use uppercase for SQL keywords (as shown) for better readability.
- If using user input for `CustomerID`, sanitize or use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Add comments if this query is part of a complex script to describe its purpose.
