Hereâ€™s a review of your code:

```sql
select from Customer where CustomerID>30
```

### Issues Found

1. **Missing Column List**  
   In SQL, you must specify which columns to select, or use `*` to select all:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30
   ```

2. **Capitalization (Best Practice)**  
   While not required, it is standard SQL convention to write keywords in uppercase for readability. Your code could be:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30
   ```

3. **Semicolon (Optional, but Recommended)**  
   Some SQL clients expect queries to end with a semicolon:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
   ```

### Recommendation

Change your query to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

**Optional:** If you only need certain columns, specify them instead of `*`:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

#### Summary
- List columns to select (or use *)
- Use proper SQL syntax and casing
- Add a semicolon if required
