Certainly! Here’s your code:

```sql
select from Customer where CustomerID>30
```

### Review

#### 1. **Syntax Error**
The `SELECT` statement is incomplete—you must specify which columns to retrieve (e.g., `SELECT *`, or `SELECT CustomerID, Name`, etc.).  
**Correct syntax:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
or, for specific columns:
```sql
SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

#### 2. **Capitalization (Optional for SQL)**
While SQL is case-insensitive, using uppercase for SQL keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) and lowercase or PascalCase for identifiers (`Customer`, `CustomerID`) improves readability and follows convention.

#### 3. **Semicolon**
Ending SQL commands with a semicolon (`;`) is good practice, especially when running multiple commands.

---

**Summary of issues:**  
- You must specify columns to select.
- Consider best practices for capitalization and semicolons.

**Final corrected query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
