1. Corrected Code
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 10;
```

2. Syntax Errors
✅ No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- Use consistent and meaningful casing for keywords and identifiers. (E.g., use "CustomerID" or "CustomerId" consistently with your schema.)
- Prefer explicitly listing column names instead of using `*` for clarity and performance, e.g., `SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customer...` (if applicable).
- Ensure that the column name "CustomerID" matches the actual schema’s casing.

4. Requirement Mismatch

**Mismatch Identified:**  
The requirement specifies selecting Customers *where CustomerID > 10*.  
Your uploaded code:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
This incorrectly uses `> 30` instead of `> 10`.

**Correction:**  
Change `CustomerID > 30` to `CustomerID > 10` to satisfy the requirement.

**Conclusion:**  
The uploaded code does **not** satisfy the requirement as written. Use the corrected code provided in section 1.
