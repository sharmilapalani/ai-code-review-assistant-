1. Corrected Code

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 10;
```

2. Syntax Errors

âœ… No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- Use consistent casing for SQL keywords (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) for readability. Your original code is fine in this regard.
- Consider selecting only required columns instead of `*` for better performance and clarity, unless all columns are specifically needed.
- Ensure you use the correct column name. SQL is case-insensitive for column and table names in most RDBMS, but consistency is good practice.
- Always end SQL statements with a semicolon as you have.

4. Requirement Mismatch

- **Mismatch identified:** The requirement specifies displaying customer details where `CustomerId > 10`. Your query used `CustomerID > 30`, which does not satisfy the condition.
- **Fix:** Change `CustomerID > 30` to `CustomerID > 10`.
- **Conclusion:** The uploaded code does **not** fully satisfy the requirement. Use the corrected code above.
