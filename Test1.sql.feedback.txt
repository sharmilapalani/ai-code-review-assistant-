1. Corrected Code
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
(The code is already correct.)

2. Syntax Errors
✅ No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- **Explicit Columns:** Instead of using `SELECT *`, specify the columns needed. This improves readability, performance (as unnecessary columns aren't fetched), and helps maintain backward compatibility if the schema changes.
    ```sql
    SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, ... FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
    ```
- **Indexing:** Ensure that `CustomerID` is indexed (ideally, it is a primary key) for better performance on the `WHERE` clause.
- **Semicolon:** Including the semicolon is good SQL practice, especially if the script contains multiple statements.

**Summary:**  
✅ Your code is correct. No syntax errors found.

**Optional Best Practice:**  
Avoid `SELECT *` in production code—select only the columns you need.
