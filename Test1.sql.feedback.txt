1. Corrected Code:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

2. Syntax Errors:
- The original SQL statement is missing the column list after `SELECT` (such as `*`), which is required.
- SQL keywords should ideally be in uppercase for readability, though it's not a syntax error.
- Missing semicolon at the end (recommended for SQL scripts).

3. Suggestions / Improvements:
- Always specify the columns you need instead of using `*` for better performance and clarity, e.g. `SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customer ...` if you only need certain columns.
- Use consistent SQL keyword casing (uppercase is standard for readability).
- Include comments if this is part of a larger script to explain the queryâ€™s purpose.

**Example with best practices:**
```sql
-- Retrieve all customers with CustomerID greater than 30
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
