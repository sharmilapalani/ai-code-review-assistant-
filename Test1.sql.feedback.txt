2. Syntax Errors  
✅ No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements
- **Explicit Column Selection**: Instead of using `SELECT *`, it's good practice to specify only the columns you need (e.g., `SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customer`). This improves performance and clarity, especially as your table grows or changes.
- **Indexing**: Make sure that `CustomerID` is indexed for optimal filter performance, though this is usually the case if it's a primary key.
- **Semicolon Usage**: Your use of a semicolon to terminate the statement is good for clarity and compatibility, especially in multi-statement scripts.
- **Readability**: Add a comment if the query is for a specific purpose to clarify intent for future readers.

**Example with specified columns:**
```sql
SELECT CustomerID, Name, Email FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
