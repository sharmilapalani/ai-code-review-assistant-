1. Corrected Code  
✅ The code is syntactically correct. No changes needed.

2. Syntax Errors  
✅ No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements  

- Explicit Columns: Instead of using SELECT *, list out the specific columns you need (e.g., SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customer ...). This is best practice for both performance and maintainability, especially in production environments.
- Table Naming: Ensure naming conventions are followed (singular vs plural table names). "Customer" is fine, but consistency is key.
- Indexing: If queries will frequently filter by CustomerID, ensure an index exists on that column for performance.
- Formatting: For readability, you may want to format SQL keywords in uppercase (which you have done) and maintain consistent indentation.

    Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName
    FROM Customer
    WHERE CustomerID > 30;
    ```

4. Requirement Mismatch  
There was no feature/description provided.
- If you intend to filter customers with IDs greater than 30, the code matches the (implied) requirement.
- If the requirement was different, please provide more details.

**Summary:**  
Your SQL statement is correct and functional, but for large-scale or production use, avoid SELECT * and specify columns explicitly. Otherwise, the code performs as expected given the lack of further requirements.
