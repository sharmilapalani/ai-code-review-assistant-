1. Corrected Code

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

2. Syntax Errors

- The SELECT statement is missing a column list or a wildcard (*). SQL syntax requires `SELECT column(s)` or `SELECT *`.
- The SQL statement is missing a semicolon (`;`) at the end (optional in some databases, but good practice).

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- Explicitly list the column names you need instead of using `*` to improve performance and clarity, e.g., `SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;`
- Use consistent capitalization for SQL keywords for readability.
- Add comments if appropriate to explain why filtering for CustomerID > 30.
- If you're working with a large database, consider using indexes on `CustomerID` for better performance.
- Ensure the table and column names match your actual schema (some systems are case-sensitive).
