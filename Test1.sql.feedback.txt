**Review:**

The SQL statement you provided has a syntax error. The correct `SELECT` statement should specify the columns to retrieve or use `*` for all columns. The correct syntax is:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

**Corrections:**
- Added `*` after `SELECT`
- Uppercased the keywords for clarity (optional, but recommended)
- Added a semicolon at the end (optional, but good practice)

**Corrected Code:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
