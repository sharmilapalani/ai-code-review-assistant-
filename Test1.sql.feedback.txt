1. Corrected Code

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 10;
```

2. Syntax Errors

✅ No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- Be consistent with column naming (use either CustomerID or CustomerId, matching the actual schema).
- Prefer listing column names explicitly (e.g., `SELECT CustomerID, Name, ...`) instead of `*` for better clarity and maintainability.
- Use proper formatting and capitalization for readability:
  - Keywords in uppercase: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`.
  - Table and column names as per schema standards/casing.

4. Requirement Mismatch

**Mismatch Identified:**  
The uploaded code filters customers where `CustomerID > 30`, while the requirement specifies `CustomerId > 10`. Thus, the logic does NOT match the description, as it excludes valid records (e.g., CustomerID 11–30).

**Correction Provided:**  
Change the filter from `CustomerID > 30` to `CustomerID > 10` as shown in the corrected code.

**Summary:**  
The requirement is NOT satisfied. Please update the query to use `CustomerID > 10` per the instructions.
