Thank you for providing your SQL query. Hereâ€™s a review:

### Your Query:
```sql
select from Customer where CustomerID > 30
```

---

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Column List:**
   - The `SELECT` statement must specify which columns to return.
   - Example: `SELECT *` for all columns, or `SELECT CustomerID, Name` for specific columns.

2. **Readability:**
   - SQL keywords are typically written in uppercase for better readability.

## Corrected Version

If you want all columns:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

Or, if you want specific columns (e.g., CustomerID and Name):
```sql
SELECT CustomerID, Name
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

---

## Summary

- Always specify columns in the `SELECT` statement.
- Use SQL keyword casing for clarity.
- Always end statements with a semicolon where required (depends on environment).
