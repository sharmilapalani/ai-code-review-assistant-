Hereâ€™s a review of your SQL query:

**Your code:**
```sql
select from Customer where CustomerID>30
```

**Issues & Improvements:**

1. **Missing column list in SELECT:**  
   SQL requires you to specify the columns you want to retrieve after `SELECT`. If you want all columns, use `*`. For specific columns, list them, e.g., `SELECT CustomerID, Name`.

2. **Corrected Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
   ```
   Or, for example:
   ```sql
   SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
   ```

3. **Code Style:**  
   - Use uppercase for SQL keywords for readability.
   - End statements with a semicolon (optional for some environments, but recommended).

**Summary:**  
You need to specify the columns you wish to select. Otherwise, this will raise a syntax error.
