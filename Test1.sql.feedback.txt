Thank you for sharing your SQL code for review. Here are several points of feedback:

### Original Query
```sql
select from Customer where CustomerID>30
```

### Issues and Suggestions

1. **SELECT List Missing**

   - The `SELECT` statement is missing the columns you wish to retrieve. You need to specify columns or use `*` for all columns.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
   ```
   Or, to improve clarity and efficiency, specify only needed columns:
   ```sql
   SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
   ```

2. **SQL Case Conventions (Optional, but encouraged)**

   - Use uppercase for SQL keywords for readability, which youâ€™ve already done.

3. **Semicolon (Optional, but recommended)**

   - It's generally good practice to end SQL statements with a semicolon.

### Final Improved Query Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
or, with specific columns:
```sql
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

**Summary:**  
- Always specify columns in the `SELECT` statement.
- Close your statement with a semicolon.
- Consider listing only the columns you need for performance and clarity.
