- **Explicit Columns**: Instead of using `SELECT *`, it is generally a best practice to explicitly specify the columns you need (e.g., `SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customer`). This enhances readability and reduces the load on the database if the table has many columns.
- **Index Usage**: Ensure that there is an index on the `CustomerID` column to optimize the performance of the `WHERE CustomerID > 30` condition.
- **Semicolon Usage**: While the trailing semicolon is not strictly necessary in all SQL dialects, it is a good habit as it helps when you have multiple queries.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent capitalization for SQL keywords and identifiers according to your project's style guide.

Example following best practices:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

If you have specific columns you want to retrieve, it's better to list them explicitly. If you truly need all columns, your original query is fine.
