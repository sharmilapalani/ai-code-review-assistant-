1. Corrected Code  
```sql

```
✅ No changes required; the code is syntactically correct.

2. Syntax Errors  
✅ No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements  

- **Explicit Column Selection:** It's best practice to avoid `SELECT *`; specify the required columns to improve performance and readability. For example:
  ```sql
  SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, Address -- etc.
  FROM Customer
  WHERE CustomerID > 30;
  ```
- **Indexing:** Ensure that an index exists on the `CustomerID` column for better query performance, especially on large tables.
- **Semicolon Usage:** The semicolon at the end is good practice for statement termination in SQL.
- **Consistency in Naming:** Ensure your table and column names use consistent case and naming conventions throughout your project.
- **Commenting:** Adding comments describing the purpose of the query can aid maintenance.
