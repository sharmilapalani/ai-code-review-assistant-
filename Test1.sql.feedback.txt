Hereâ€™s a review of your SQL code:

**Original code:**
```sql
select from Customer where CustomerID > 30
```

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Syntax Error:**  
   The `SELECT` statement requires you to specify the columns you want to retrieve.  
   - `SELECT *` for all columns  
   - `SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName`, etc. for specific columns

2. **No Semicolon:**  
   While not strictly required in all SQL clients, it's good practice to terminate statements with a semicolon.

**Corrected code (retrieve all columns):**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

**Suggestions:**

- If you only need some columns, enumerate them for performance and clarity:
    ```sql
    SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName
    FROM Customer
    WHERE CustomerID > 30;
    ```
- Add `ORDER BY` if you want sorted results.
