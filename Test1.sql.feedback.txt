Here is a review of your SQL query:

**Your code:**
```sql
select from Customer where CustomerID>30
```

---

### Issues Identified

1. **Missing Columns in SELECT Statement**

   - You must specify which columns to select, or use `*` to select all columns.
   - The correct basic syntax:  
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table WHERE condition;
     ```

2. **SQL Keywords Not Properly Capitalized (Optional/Style)**

   - While not mandatory, capitalizing SQL keywords improves readability.

### Corrected Query

If you want to select *all* columns for customers with `CustomerID > 30`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

Or, if you want specific columns (for clarity):

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

---

### Suggestions

- Always specify what you want to select.
- Follow SQL best practices for readability (capitalizing keywords).
- Consider explicitly naming columns instead of using `*` for better maintainability.

**Summary:**  
Your current query is missing the column specification in the `SELECT` clause, which will result in a syntax error (in most SQL dialects). Adjust as shown above for proper function.
