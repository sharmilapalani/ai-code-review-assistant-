Here are some observations and suggestions for the code you provided:

### 1. SQL Syntax Error
The SQL statement is missing the `SELECT` keywordâ€™s column list (or `*`) and is malformed. The correct syntax should be:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
or, if you want to select specific columns:
```sql
SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

### 2. Semicolon Terminator
While not always required, it's standard practice to end SQL statements with a semicolon (`;`). This improves portability and avoids issues in certain SQL clients.

### 3. Code Style & Clarity
- SQL keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) are conventionally written in uppercase for readability.
- Indent your code properly, especially with more complex queries.

### 4. Safety Considerations
- If `CustomerID` is a numeric field, your usage is appropriate.
- If you are using user input for the `CustomerID`, beware of SQL injection risks.

### 5. Optional: Documentation / Comments
If this query is part of a larger script, consider adding a comment explaining what the query is doing.

**Corrected example:**
```sql
-- Select customers with CustomerID greater than 30
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

**Summary:**  
Your SQL statement is missing the column selection after the `SELECT` keyword. Use `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns, and adjust as suggested for best practices.
