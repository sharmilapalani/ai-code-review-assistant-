1. Corrected Code
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

2. Syntax Errors  
The original code has minor spacing issues which do not typically cause a syntax error in many SQL engines, but it's best practice to maintain proper spacing for readability. The syntactically correct version is above.

3. Suggestions / Improvements
- **Readability:** Add spaces between SQL keywords for better readability.
- **Best Practice:** Avoid using `SELECT *`; instead, specify only the columns you need. This improves performance and makes your code more maintainable.
- **Semicolon:** Itâ€™s a good practice to end SQL statements with a semicolon.
- **Case Style:** Use uppercase for SQL keywords for clarity.

**Example using best practices:**
```sql
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName -- (replace with actual column names you need)
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
