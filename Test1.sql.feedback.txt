1. Corrected Code  
```sql

```

2. Syntax Errors  
âœ… No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements  
- Use uppercase for SQL keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) for better readability and SQL style conventions.
- Avoid using `SELECT *` in production code. Instead, list specific columns you need, e.g., `SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;`, as this makes your code more readable and efficient.
- If your database is case-sensitive, ensure table and column names are spelled correctly.
- Consider adding an `ORDER BY` clause if you want a consistent result order.

Example with suggested improvements:
```sql
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID > 30
ORDER BY CustomerID;
```
