1. Corrected Code
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 10;
```

2. Syntax Errors  
✅ No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements  
- Use consistent casing for SQL keywords (e.g., SELECT, FROM, WHERE) for readability.
- If you only need specific columns, avoid using SELECT *; specify the required columns for better performance and clarity.
- Consider adding an ORDER BY clause if you want predictable results.

4. Requirement Mismatch  
The uploaded code does not match the description. The code filters for CustomerID > 30, but the requirement is to select customers where CustomerID > 10. The WHERE clause should be corrected to CustomerID > 10.

**Rules Engine Check:** ❌ Mismatch detected by rules engine: value: expected '10', found '30'
**Rules Engine Correction:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 10;
