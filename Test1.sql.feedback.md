# Code Review Feedback for `Test1.sql`

## Description
Display all the records from Customer Table

## Uploaded Code
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;

```

## AI Feedback
1. Corrected Code

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer;
```

2. Syntax Errors

âœ… No syntax errors found.

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- Avoid using unnecessary WHERE clauses unless specified by the requirements.
- Use `SELECT *` only when you need all columns; for production code, explicitly list columns to improve maintainability.
- Ensure table and column names are consistently capitalized, according to your SQL style guide.

4. Requirement Mismatch

**Requirement:** Display all the records from Customer Table.

**Uploaded Code:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
- The provided code only displays records where `CustomerID > 30`.  
- This does **not** display **all** the records from the `Customer` table.

**Conclusion:** The code does **not** satisfy the requirement.  
**Correction:** Remove the `WHERE` clause as shown in the corrected code above.
