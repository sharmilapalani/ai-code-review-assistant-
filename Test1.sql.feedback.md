## Description
Select the Student Details from Student Table where name Starts with A

## Uploaded Code

```

## AI Feedback

```

2. Syntax Errors

✅ No syntax errors found in the uploaded code.

---

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- It is best practice to explicitly specify the columns needed rather than using `*`, e.g., `SELECT StudentID, name, ...`.
- Use meaningful and consistent column and table names. The uploaded code uses `Customer` and `CustomerID`, which do not match the described requirement.
- For performance: If the `name` column is not indexed and the table is large, consider indexing it if such queries are frequent.

4. Requirement Mismatch

**Requirement:**  
Select the Student Details from Student Table where name Starts with A.

**Uploaded Code:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```

**Analysis:**  
- The code selects all columns from the `Customer` table, not the `Student` table.  
- It filters by `CustomerID > 30`, which has no relation to filtering students whose names start with 'A'.  
- It does not match the requirement at all.

**Correct Query:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

**Conclusion:**  
❌ The uploaded code does NOT satisfy the requirement.  
Refer to the "Corrected Code" section above for the appropriate query.
