# Code Review Feedback for `Test1.sql`

## Description
Display all the records from STUDENT Table where the NAME starts with A

## Uploaded Code
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;

```

## AI Feedback
1. Corrected Code
```sql
SELECT * FROM STUDENT WHERE NAME LIKE 'A%';
```

2. Syntax Errors
✅ No syntax errors found in the uploaded code.

3. Suggestions / Improvements

- Use meaningful table and column names as per the requirement (STUDENT, NAME).
- The pattern-matching condition should use LIKE with the appropriate string pattern ('A%').
- Always end SQL statements with a semicolon (good).
- Use uppercase SQL keywords for readability (as you did—good practice).

4. Requirement Mismatch

**Uploaded Code:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID > 30;
```
**Requirement:**  
Display all the records from STUDENT Table where the NAME starts with A.

**Analysis:**  
- The code queries from the `Customer` table, not the `STUDENT` table.
- It filters by `CustomerID > 30`, unrelated to names starting with 'A'.
- There is no filtering on the `NAME` column to check for names starting with 'A'.

**Corrected Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM STUDENT WHERE NAME LIKE 'A%';
```
**Conclusion:**  
❌ The uploaded code does **not** satisfy the requirement. Please use the corrected query above to fulfill the described task.
